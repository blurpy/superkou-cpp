Super Kou C++
=============


This version of Super Kou is written in C++, using the Qt4 framework. You need Qt4 and gcc/g++ to compile the source code.
This is something I wrote while learning to program C++ in school, and is based on an older version of Super Kou in Java.

Note: the game is in Norwegian.


Steps to compile on Windows:
1. Download Qt4 for Windows with MinGW (gcc for Windows) from http://qt-project.org/
2. Clone the Super Kou source code to a folder.
3. Start Qt 4.x.x Command Prompt from the start menu.
4. Navigate to the src folder using the command prompt.
5. Run 'qmake'
6. Run 'make'
7. Copy 'mingwm10.dll', 'QtCore4.dll' and 'QtGui4.dll' to the root folder where superkou.exe is. You can find those files in the bin folder where you installed Qt4.
8. Done! You can start the game using superkou.exe. You can safely delete the src folder.
Note: The steps have not been verified on Windows since 2006.

Steps to compile on Linux:
1. Install Qt4 and gcc/g++ using your distribution's package manager.
2. Clone the Super Kou source code to a folder.
3. Open a terminal.
4. Navigate to the src folder using the terminal.
5. Run 'qmake'
6. Run 'make'
7. Done! You can start the game using the superkou binary. You can safely delete the src folder. You can use bilder/kou.png as a shortcut icon.

Steps to compile on Mac:
1. Probably something like the Windows or Linux method.

Qt Creator can also be used, as a more graphical build tool. It knows what to do with the source code.
Just remember to set the working directory to the root of the project, or Super Kou wont find any resources.
